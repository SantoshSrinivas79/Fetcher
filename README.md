# Fetcher API for Meteor: Proof of Concept

Fetcher aims to provide an alternative to Meteor's Pub/Sub model for sending data to the client. The goal is to return static data to the client, help you push it on your templates, and make it easy to refresh. It's great for helping you scale down the real-time aspect of your application, so you can scale up in production! The package is intended to help you:

1. Retrieve static data from the server
2. Render data into templates
3. Refresh data on demand 

This package relies on Method's and Reactive-Dict to work. By standardizing the functionality into a package, we can make the concept easier to grasp and build debug tools around it. Most importantly, it would be really nice to have a clean and simple API to work with. 

# Current Status

Project is currently a proof of concept to see if there is any interest. You can see a demo at <a href="http://fetcher.meteor.com">http://fetcher.meteor.com</a>

# API

Fetcher relies on Meteor methods to retrieve data, and Reactive-Dict to return reactive data to Blaze.
```javascript
// get data from server
Fetcher.retrieve("name", param1, param2)

// get data from server using same parameters
Fetcher.refresh("name")

// overwrite the data yourself
// userful for join, transform, etc
Fetcher.set("dowhatever")  

// return data to whatever source
Fetcher.get("name")
```

# Package Goals

 - Create a clean and simple API for working with static data
 - Plug into Meteor Publications for permissions/etc
 - Only publish changes in data instead of entire dataset (similar to MergeBox)
 - Make it easy to switch from Fetcher to a real-time subscription
 - Keep track of when data was last updated
